# Using LUMI-O object storage 

For storing and sharing data, there is available a separate _object storage_, LUMI-O, for LUMI users. LUMI-O can be accessed via LUMI, both with connection via ssh and with using the LUMI web interface. Also one can use LUMI-O without accessing the LUMI supercomputer (which might be useful e.g. during some LUMI service breaks, during which LUMI-O might be normally available).

LUMI-O is a S3 compatible object storage, based on Ceph Reef (v18.2.2). 

Some benefits of LUMI-O:
- LUMI-O can fit up to 30 PB of data per project
- Data lifetime on LUMI-O is the same as your project lifetime
- Can be used as a backup of your data that you have on your /project and /scratch locations
- Can be used to share data outside of project members (privately, or making the content public)

Guide for LUMI-O in the LUMI documentation: https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/


## Tutorial: Accessing LUMI-O via the LUMI web interface

1. Go to the LUMI web interface: <https://www.lumi.csc.fi>
2. Login with using your identity provider
3. Select *Cloud storage configuration* from the *Pinned Apps* view on the dashboard.
4. From "Configure new remotes", choose LUMI-O.
5. From the drop-down menu, select the project you want to use for this exercise.
6. Tic both of the selections to configure both public and private remotes.
   - You may skip the previous step if you've already configured a connection.

ðŸ’¡ Now you'll be able to browse your _buckets_ and _objects_ in LUMI-O using the *Files* app!

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 4"}
1. From the *Files* dropdown menu in the top navigation bar, select `lumi-<id>-public` where `<id>` is the number of your project (e.g. 465000000).
2. Create a new bucket by pressing the *New Directory* button.
   - Name it as `<id>_<username>`, in which `<id>` is again the number of your project and `<username>` is your LUMI username. Note that you cannot use a bucket name that already exists!
3. Open the created bucket by clicking it.
4. Upload one file from your computer into the bucket (any file should do, but prefer a file that you can open in LUMI, e.g. a text file).

ðŸ’­ During the exercises, you can use this web interface to get another view to your buckets and objects in LUMI-O.

## Accessing LUMI-O from LUMI (via terminal)

### Preparations (if not done already)

1. Login to `lumi.csc.fi` via terminal (or open a login node shell, if using the LUMI web interface)
2. Once you have a terminal open on a LUMI login node, check your environment with the command

```bash
lumi-workspaces
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 2"}
3. Move to the scratch directory of your project:

```bash
cd /scratch/<project>   # replace <project> with your LUMI project, e.g. project_465000000
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Create your own subdirectory named as your username (tip! your username is automatically stored in the environment variable `$USER`):

```bash
mkdir -p $USER
cd $USER
```

### Connecting to LUMI-O

1. Open a connection to LUMI-O with these commands:

```bash
module load lumio
lumio-conf 
```

After this you are asked to login to: https://auth.lumidata.eu/
Please follow the guidance described here in the LUMI documentation: https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/auth-lumidata-eu/

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
2. If you have several projects with access to LUMI-O available, select the one where you just created a bucket using the LUMI web interface

After creating the credentials for your chosen project, give the LUMI project number, e.g.

`465000000`

in the terminal. Next give teh access key you just generated, e.g. something like:

`IXZLOSAF2E3MD42T840B`

Finally, give the secret key, e.g. something like: 
`rwfkhpNtUSvVZ2R2Pw4qsLkWetTKsd7dC5DBxS98`


3. Study what you have in LUMI-O with [rclone](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/#__tabbed_1_1) or with [s3cmd](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/#__tabbed_1_2)

- With `rclone`:

```bash
rclone lsd lumi-o:
rclone ls lumi-o:<id>_$USER
rclone lsl lumi-o:<id>_$USER
rclone lsf lumi-o:<id>_$USER
rclone cat lumi-o:<id>_$USER/<filename>
```

The bucket `<id>_$USER` is the one we just created in the first exercise using the LUMI web interface.

- With `s3cmd`:

```bash
s3cmd ls s3:
s3cmd ls s3://<id>_$USER
s3cmd lsl s3://<id>_$USER
s3cmd lsf s3://<id>_$USER
s3cmd cat s3://<id>_$USER/<filename>
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 3"}
4. Download to LUMI the file that you just uploaded from your local computer to LUMI-O. This can be done e.g. with rclone or s3cmd:

- With `rclone`:

```bash
rclone copy lumi-o:<id>_$USER/<filename> ./    # replace <id> with your LUMI project number, e.g. 465000000, and <filename> with the file you uploaded
```

- With `s3cmd`:

```bash
...
```


{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 4"}
5. Open, edit and rename the file so that you can distinguish it from the original one
6. Upload the new file to LUMI-O:

- With `rclone`:

```bash
rclone copy <newfilename> lumi-o:<id>_$USER/   # replace <newfilename> and <id> accordingly
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 6"}
7. Check that the file in LUMI indeed has a counterpart in LUMI-O:

```bash
rclone ...
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 7"}
8. Locate the files you just uploaded to LUMI-O in the LUMI web interface (search for the bucket name)

### Clean up

1. Delete the local file from LUMI:

```bash
rm <filename>             # replace <filename>
```

{:style="counter-reset:step-counter 1"}
2. Whenever you need your data again, you can download it from LUMI-O

ðŸ’­ If you can't find your file but remember the name, try 
... (insert find commands rclone / s3cmd)


## Advanced: Using LUMI-O without connecting to LUMI

(Comment: This might belong to LUMI docs instead of here.)

(Useful for example during a LUMI servcie break, when LUMI-O might be normally available.)

One can use LUMI-O also without connecting to LUMI. This is an example with rclone.

1) Follow directions at https://rclone.org/install/ to install rclone on your local machine, if you don't have it already.

2) Set LUMI-O access credentials at https://auth.lumidata.eu/ for your project

3) Create an rclone.conf file (to the path ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf) on your local machine:

```bash
# An example of an rclone config file. 
# Objects will inherit the default properties from buckets. 

[lumi-project-private]
# Buckets created with this endpoint configuration are private by default.
type = s3
acl = private
env_auth = false
provider = Ceph
endpoint = https://lumidata.eu/
access_key_id = XXX  # Replace with your created LUMI-O access key
secret_access_key = YYY  # Replace with your created LUMI-O secret access key

[lumi-project-public]
# Buckets created with this endpoint configuration are visible for all.
type = s3
acl = public-read
env_auth = false
provider = Ceph
endpoint = https://lumidata.eu/
access_key_id = XXX  # Replace with your created LUMI-O access key
secret_access_key = YYY # Replace with your created LUMI-O secret access key

```

4) Run `rclone config` # Is this necessary?

5) Use LUMI-O with rclone commands from your local machine, e.g. to list all the buckets of your project:

```bash
rclone lsd lumi-project-private:
```
