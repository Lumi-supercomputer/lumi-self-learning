# Terminal and Web interface

(Should this page be combined with the 'prerequisities' page?)

There are two options that you can use LUMI with. 

One can use LUMI both traditionally with ssh via terminal, or with a web browser via the LUMI web interface. 

The beginning of this page should answer at least the following questions:

- What is the web interface good for, and what it is not suitable for?
- How to login to LUMI via terminal and via the Web interface (or only links to the related pages in LUMI docs?)

## Login to LUMI web interface

[LUMI web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/).

or direct link:

https://www.lumi.csc.fi/

Maybe a picture of the view after login, and some short explanation without going too much details at this point. The point is that the reader knows how/where to check things via the web interface, and how to open the terminal, at this point. 

A more detailed tutorial about LUMI web interface will follow later in the guide? 
Also link to the LUMI docs, let's not rewrite this. 

## Login to LUMI via terminal

? Should we show it here ?
