# Using LUMI-O object storage 

The object storage available on LUMI has many benefits:
- It can fit up to 30 PB of data per project
- Data lifetime same as your project lifetime
- Can be used as a backup of your data that you have on your /project and /scratch locations
- Can be used to share data outside of project members (privately, or making the content public)

There's a good introduction of how to access LUMI-O in the LUMI documentation, which we don't see a reason to re-write: https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/storage/lumio/
