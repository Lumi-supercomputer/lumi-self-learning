====================

Welcome to the *Introduction to LUMI* self-learning course!

.. warning::

   This material is in development. Stay tuned!

About the course
----------------

This self-learning course is intended for anyone interested in using the LUMI
supercomputer. The course consists of N sections focusing on how to use the LUMI
computing environment. The material is organized by topics of increasing complexity
-- feel free to jump if you know the basics already. In each section, read the
text and complete the tutorial(s) to make sure you've understood the content.

After completing the course, you should possess the necessary skills to use the
LUMI computing environment efficiently in different phases of your research
and/or development projects and know where to look for more information.

.. prereq::

   It is expected that you know the basics of Linux and how to work in a
   command-line interface (CLI).
