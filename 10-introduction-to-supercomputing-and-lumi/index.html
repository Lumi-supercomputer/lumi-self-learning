<h1>Introduction to supercomputing and LUMI<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-supercomputing-and-lumi" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Frequently, research problems that use computing can outgrow the capabilities
of the desktop or laptop computer where they started:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A statistics student wants to cross-validate a model. This involves running
the model 1000 times – but each run takes an hour. Running the model on
a laptop will take over a month! In this research problem, final results are
calculated after all 1000 models have run, but typically only one model is
run at a time (in <strong>serial</strong>) on the laptop. Since each of the 1000 runs is
independent of all others, and given enough computers, it’s theoretically
possible to run them all at once (in <strong>parallel</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>A genomics researcher has been using small datasets of sequence data, but
soon will be receiving a new type of sequencing data that is 10 times as
large. It’s already challenging to open the datasets on a computer –
analyzing these larger datasets will probably crash it. In this research
problem, the calculations required might be impossible to parallelize, but a
computer with <strong>more memory</strong> would be required to analyze the much larger
future data set.</p></li>
<li><p>An engineer is using a fluid dynamics package that has an option to run in
parallel. So far, this option was not used on a desktop. In going from 2D
to 3D simulations, the simulation time has more than tripled. It might be
useful to take advantage of that option or feature. In this research problem,
the calculations in each region of the simulation are largely independent of
calculations in other regions of the simulation. It’s possible to run each
region’s calculations simultaneously (in <strong>parallel</strong>), communicate selected
results to adjacent regions as needed, and repeat the calculations to
converge on a final set of results. In moving from a 2D to a 3D model, <strong>both
the amount of data and the amount of calculations increases greatly</strong>, and
it’s theoretically possible to distribute the calculations across multiple
computers communicating over a shared network.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, access to more (and larger) computers is needed. Those
computers should be usable at the same time, <strong>solving many researchers’
problems in parallel</strong>.</p>
<section id="notes-on-vocabulary">
<h2>Notes on vocabulary<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-on-vocabulary" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<section id="cpu">
<h3>CPU<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A central processing unit, or <strong>CPU</strong>, is perhaps one of the most important
parts of a computer. It is a processor that executes the instructions of a
computer program, i.e. performs the actual computing task. Nowadays, modern
CPUs are multi-core processors, i.e. they contain multiple subunits called
CPU <strong>cores</strong> that can run instructions at the same time, increasing the speed
of programs that support parallel computing.</p>
</section>
<section id="gpu">
<h3>GPU<a class="headerlink" href="#gpu" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Graphics processing units, or <strong>GPUs</strong>, are massively parallel processors that
were originally developed for running computer graphics. Since computer
graphics are essentially about performing highly parallelizable linear algebra
operations that are encountered also in many other domains of computational
science, GPUs have evolved to become more widely used also for non-graphic
computing tasks. Nowadays GPUs are widely used, for example, for training AI
models and running molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>Note, however, that not all algorithms and computational problems can make
efficient use of GPUs due to their highly parallel nature. Programming software
that can run on GPUs also requires using special programming languages or
frameworks like <strong>CUDA</strong> for Nvidia GPUs and <strong>HIP</strong> for AMD GPUs.</p>
</section>
<section id="memory">
<h3>Memory<a class="headerlink" href="#memory" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When talking about memory, we usually refer to random-access memory, or
<strong>RAM</strong>. You can think of RAM as the short-term memory of a computer. It is
very fast compared to regular disk space (hard drive), and processing data in
memory is generally the most efficient option when running your computer
programs. Sometimes the data can, however, be so large that it does not fit
into memory, in which case some temporary files may need to be written to disk.
This can be a significant performance bottleneck. A modern consumer workstation
often has on the order of 8–64 GiB of RAM, while supercomputers may have
several TiB per node.</p>
</section>
<section id="storage">
<h3>Storage<a class="headerlink" href="#storage" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>With storage we refer to all disk space that can be accessed like a file
system. In broad terms, this is storage that can hold data “permanently”, i.e.
data is still there even if the computer is rebooted. Computer storage come
both in local (hard drive installed on the computer) and shared flavors. A
shared file system is basically a remote server to which many computers may be
connected, and is thus commonly used in supercomputers to enable accessing data
from all parts of the system. Local disks tend to be, however, faster
than shared file systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="node">
<h3>Node<a class="headerlink" href="#node" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You can roughly think that one <strong>node</strong> of a supercomputer is a single
computer. Each node in an HPC system has in principle the same components as
your own laptop or desktop workstation. Typically it contains one or more
multi-core CPUs, memory, and in some cases a fast local disk as well as one or
more GPUs.</p>
</section>
<section id="cluster">
<h3>Cluster<a class="headerlink" href="#cluster" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When multiple nodes are connected together with a fast interconnect, we get a
<strong>computer cluster</strong>. Although there is no exact definition, the term
<strong>supercomputer</strong> is often used to refer to a very large cluster system.
The nodes of a cluster are often also connected to a shared file system to
enable easy access of data from all nodes. Without a shared file system, data
would always have to be manually copied back and forth between the node local
disks depending on which node(s) a computing task is being carried out on.</p>
</section>
<section id="partition">
<h3>Partition<a class="headerlink" href="#partition" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The nodes of a cluster system are often grouped into special <strong>partitions</strong>
depending on their intended use or capabilities. At the coarsest level, nodes
are divided into <strong>user access nodes</strong> (UAN, also called <strong>login nodes</strong>) and
<strong>compute nodes</strong>. UANs are intended for light data processing and file
management, and are typically shared by hundreds of simultaneous users. It is
therefore important not to run any heavy computing tasks on the UANs. Such
workloads should instead be submitted to the compute nodes to be run as
<strong>batch jobs</strong>.</p>
<p>Compute nodes are typically further divided into different partitions depending
on the type of hardware they provide (CPU, GPU, available memory, local disk),
or what kind of restrictions have been set on their use (short/long computing
tasks, minimum/maximum number of CPU cores/GPUs allowed per job).</p>

<section id="lumi">
<h2>LUMI<a class="headerlink" href="#lumi" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>LUMI is a <strong>pre-exascale</strong> supercomputer, meaning that it has the capability to
perform almost 10<sup>18</sup> floating point operations per second. This is
mainly thanks to its large amount of GPUs. In addition to the GPU partition
<strong>LUMI-G</strong>, LUMI has several other types of partitions, such as a sizeable CPU
partition, <strong>LUMI-C</strong>. LUMI also has a
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.lumi.csc.fi"><strong>web interface</strong></a> that allows users to connect to
and use the supercomputer simply from a browser as an alternative to the more
traditional command-line interface.</p>
<p>An overview of the LUMI architecture is summarized in the table below.</p>
